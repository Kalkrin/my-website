	            	 <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">My name is Craig Colpitts. I am a Computer Systems Technology - Systems Analyst graduate from Sheridan College. I was born in Nova Scotia and lived there most my life until I moved to Ontario in 2012. Throughout high school I wasn't really sure what I wanted to pursue as far as a career but I was interested in the sciences so I figured I would give that a try. Half way through my first semester I decided that wasn't what I wanted to do with my life. I have always been interested in computers and technology but never really thought about it as a career. Finally, I decided I would give it a shot and computer programming quickly went from an interest to a passion. I first learned Java and it was the primary language used during my schooling and have picked up on some framework such as Hibernate and Spring. I also learned how to build websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as some JS frameworks, and PHP. I also learned a variety of other subjects such as Networking and Security, Oracle and MySQL databases, Systems Analyses and Design, Android and Hybrid Mobile Development as well as C#/.Net. Recently I have taken an interest to Mobile Application Development and am teaching myself Node.js, I also plan on experimenting with MEAN stack. Through my program, I have completed three co-ops, one with The City of Brampton as a Web Content Technologist and two at the Royal Bank of Canada. One as a Technical Systems Analyst and one as a Developer where I helped make a backend API in Java which was to be utilized by an IOS application and eventually android. </p>
